- **Basic Attributes**: Name (required), description (optional), parent category (optional)

#### Product Management
- **Essential Attributes**: Name, description, brand, images, price, availability
- **Physical Attributes**: Weight, dimensions for shipping calculations
- **Identification**: SKU/Product ID for unique internal identification
- **Status Management**: Active, Inactive, Discontinued states
- **Category Assignment**: Every product must belong to an active category

#### SKU Management
- **Variant Tracking**: Color, size, weight, dimensions, and other differentiating attributes
- **Pricing**: Individual price per SKU variant
- **Inventory Levels**: Real-time stock quantity tracking
