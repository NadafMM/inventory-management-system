## Database Migration Issues Fixed
- **Status**: Completed
- **Completion Date**: 2025-01-11
- **Issues Found and Fixed**:
  1. **Schema Mismatch**: Hibernate was overriding Flyway migrations due to `ddl-auto: create-drop` in dev profile

  3. **Configuration Issues**: 
     - Flyway was disabled in application.yml
     - Hibernate DDL was set to create-drop instead of validate
  4. **Resolution**:
     - Enabled Flyway with `baseline-on-migrate: true`
     - Changed Hibernate DDL mode to `validate` in all profiles
