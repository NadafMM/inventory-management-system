* It will be used by an Admin with full access to manage products, categories, and SKUs. 
* Authentication and authorization are *not* in scope for this assignment. 

**2. Entities & Relationships:**
* **Category:** Used to group products (e.g., Electronics, Apparel). 
* **Product:** Represents a general product concept (e.g., "iPhone 15"). 
* **SKU:** Represents a sellable variant of a product (e.g., "iPhone 15 - 128GB - Black"). 
* **Relationships:**
    * A Product belongs to one Category. 
    * A Product can have many SKUs. 
    * A SKU belongs to one Product.

        * Pagination (page & pageSize params). 
    * Each Product must belong to an existing Category. 
* **SKU:**
    * Add, Update, Delete SKUs for a Product. 
    * Each SKU must belong to a valid Product. 
    * Return all SKUs of a product. 

**4. Expectations:**
* The code should be production grade. 
* All necessary validations, relationships, and edge cases must be handled. 
* Unit tests are required, along with a coverage report.

### 1\. Business Logic & Data Model Questions

These questions define the core functionality and data structures of the inventory system.

#### Category Management

  * **Can categories be nested/hierarchical? (Electronics \> Smartphones \> Apple)**
      * Yes, nested categories are preferred.
  * **Should category deletion be soft or hard delete?**
      * Category deletion should be soft.
  * **Any category-specific attributes needed? (description, image, etc.)**
      * Description is enough.
  * **Category naming constraints? (unique names, character limits)**
      * Unique names for category names, with a limit of 255 characters.

#### Product Management

  * **What product attributes are required? (name, description, brand, weight, dimensions, etc.)**

      * **Essential Product Attributes**
        For online listings, you generally need these **core product attributes**:

          * **Name:** Clear and descriptive product title.
          * **Description:** Detailed explanation of features and benefits.
          * **Brand:** Manufacturer or brand name.
          * **Images:** High-quality photos from various angles.
          * **Price:** Selling price.
          * **Availability/Stock Level:** Current inventory status.

      * **Often Required Attributes**
        These are frequently necessary for sales and shipping:

          * **Weight:** For shipping calculations.
          * **Dimensions:** Physical size (Length, Width, Height) for shipping and customer understanding.
          * **SKU/Product ID:** Unique internal identifier.
          * **Category:** For proper categorization (e.g., "Electronics \> Laptops").
          * **Condition:** New, used, refurbished, etc.

      * **Other Important Attributes (Product-Specific)**
        Depending on the product and platform, consider:

          * **Variants:** Options like Size, Color, Material.
          * **UPC/GTIN:** International barcode for retail.
          * **Key Features:** Concise bullet points of highlights.
          * **Technical Specifications:** Detailed specs for electronics.
          * **Warranty Information:** Details on product guarantee.

  * **Product status management needed? (active, inactive, discontinued)**

      * Yes, product status management is needed. The following statuses are recommended:
          * **Active:** The product is available for sale and appears in listings.
          * **Inactive:** The product is temporarily not available for sale (e.g., out of season, awaiting restock), but can be reactivated. It typically would not appear in public listings.
          * **Discontinued:** The product is permanently no longer offered for sale and will not be restocked or reactivated. This status can be used for archival purposes.

  * **Product images or media handling required?**

      * Yes, product images are required.

  * **Any product code/identifier requirements beyond auto-generated IDs?**

      * SKU/Product ID as a unique internal identifier is needed.

#### SKU Management

  * **What SKU attributes are essential? (price, stock quantity, weight, dimensions, color, size, etc.)**
    The essential SKU attributes include:

      * **Unique Identifier (the SKU itself):** To represent a sellable variant.
      * **Product ID/Reference:** To establish that "A SKU belongs to one Product".
      * **Attributes that define the variant:** This would typically include `color`, `size`, `weight`, `dimensions`, or any other characteristic that differentiates one sellable variant from another.
      * **Price:** Fundamental for any sellable item.
      * **Stock Quantity:** Essential for inventory management of a "sellable variant".

  * **SKU Naming/Code Generation Strategy:**

      * **Preferred Strategy:** Pattern-based, auto-generated with manual override option.
      * **Default:** Auto-generate using a pattern (e.g., \[ProductCode]-\[ColorCode]-\[SizeCode]) ensuring uniqueness.
      * **Override:** Allow manual input, but enforce uniqueness through validation.

  * **Inventory tracking requirements? (stock levels, low stock alerts, reserved quantities)**

      * Here are the inventory tracking requirements:
          * **Stock Levels:** Track the current quantity of each SKU in inventory.
          * **Low Stock Alerts:** Implement a mechanism to notify when SKU stock falls below a predefined threshold.
          * **Reserved Quantities:** Track quantities that are allocated or reserved for orders, but not yet shipped, to provide an accurate "available to sell" quantity.

  * **SKU status management? (active, inactive, out-of-stock)**

      * Yes, SKU status management is needed, with statuses like: `active`, `inactive`, `out-of-stock`.

-----

### 2\. Business Rules & Validations

These rules ensure data integrity and define how the system operates under various conditions.

  * **Can a product exist without any SKUs?**
      * To fulfill the core purpose of managing inventory for sellable items, every product must have at least one SKU.
  * **What happens when a category is deleted that has products?**
      * Soft delete for the category is preferred. This means the category itself is not permanently removed from the database but rather marked as inactive or deleted.
      * **Impact on Products:** Products currently assigned to a soft-deleted category should either:
          * Be unassigned: Their `category_id` field could be set to `NULL`. This would make them uncategorized, requiring an admin to reassign them to an `active` category.
          * Be moved to a default/archive category: A special "Uncategorized" or "Archived Products" category could be automatically assigned.
          * Prevent deletion: The system could prevent the soft deletion of a category if it still has active products assigned to it, forcing the admin to reassign products first.
      * Given typical needs of inventory management and to avoid "orphaned" products, preventing soft deletion if products are still assigned, or, if that's too restrictive, automatically unassigning products (setting `category_id` to `NULL`) and creating a clear process for administrators to re-categorize them, is preferred. This ensures data integrity and helps maintain a clean product catalog.
  * **Stock quantity validation rules? (negative stock allowed?)**
      * **Non-Negative:** Stock quantity cannot be negative.
      * **Zero:** `0` indicates "out of stock".
      * **Sales Prevention:** Prevent sales if it leads to negative stock.
      * **Updates:** Stock can be increased (shipments, returns, adjustments) or decreased (sales, adjustments).
      * **Initial Stock:** Must be `0` or a positive integer.
  * **Price validation requirements? (minimum price, currency handling)**
      * **Non-Negative:** Price must be a non-negative value (i.e., greater than or equal to zero).
      * **Minimum Price:** A minimum price of `0` is acceptable, implying a free item, but typically prices should be positive. For most commercial products, a domain-specific minimum (e.g., greater than `0`) might be enforced.
      * **Currency Handling:**
          * Prices should be stored and handled as a precise data type (e.g., BigDecimal in Java) to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.
          * The system needs to accommodate a specific currency (e.g., INR, USD). This could be a global setting for the service, or an attribute per product/SKU if multi-currency support is anticipated in the future.
          * Validation should ensure the price format matches the expected currency format (e.g., two decimal places for most currencies).

### 3\. Data Integrity & Error Handling

These sections cover how the system ensures data quality and manages errors.

#### Validation & Constraints

  * **Required vs optional fields for each entity?**

      * **Category**
          * **Required Fields:**
              * **Name:** Unique name, up to 255 characters.
              * **Status:** (Implicitly required for soft delete functionality, `active`/`deleted`)
          * **Optional Fields:**
              * **Description**
              * **Parent Category ID:** For nested/hierarchical categories (optional for top-level categories).
      * **Product**
          * **Required Fields:**
              * **Name:** (Implied for unique identification and search)
              * **Category ID:** Must belong to an existing Category.
          * **Optional Fields:**
              * **Description**
              * **Brand**
              * **Images**
              * **Status:** (e.g., Active, Inactive, Discontinued)
      * **SKU**
          * **Required Fields:**
              * **SKU Code/Identifier:** Unique identifier for the sellable variant.
              * **Product ID:** Must belong to a valid Product.
              * **Price**
              * **Stock Quantity**
              * **Variant-Differentiating Attributes:** At least one attribute (e.g., Color, Size, Weight, Dimensions, Capacity) that makes the SKU unique from other SKUs of the same product.
          * **Optional Fields:**
              * Any additional variant attributes not strictly required for differentiation.

  * **Data format validations? (email, phone, URL formats)**

      * **String Lengths:** Enforce character limits (e.g., category name max 255 chars).
      * **Numeric Ranges:** Prices and stock quantities must be numeric and non-negative.
      * **Data Types:** Ensure correct types (e.g., integers for quantity, decimals for price).
      * **Referential Integrity:** Validate foreign keys (e.g., Product's Category ID, SKU's Product ID).

  * **Business rule validations? (SKU price must be positive, etc.)**

      * **SKU Price:** Must be positive (greater than zero) for sellable items. A price of `0` might be allowed for "free" items, but negative prices are not permitted.
      * **Stock Quantity:** Must be a non-negative integer. Sales transactions cannot result in negative stock.
      * **Category Assignment:** A Product must be assigned to an existing, active Category.
      * **SKU Assignment:** An SKU must be assigned to an existing, active Product.
      * **Unique Names:** Category names must be unique. Product names should also be unique to avoid confusion (implied by search requirements). SKU codes must be unique.
      * **Soft Deletion Impacts:**
          * **Category Deletion:** When a category is soft-deleted, associated products should either be unassigned, moved to a default category, or the deletion should be prevented if products are still linked.
          * **Product/SKU Deletion:** While not explicitly covered for soft delete in the provided text, typically products and SKUs would also use soft delete if categories do, requiring similar rules for linked entities.

  * **Duplicate handling strategies?**

      * Uniqueness for category names, product names (implied), and SKU codes must be enforced through validation, preventing duplicates.

#### Error Handling

  * **Error response format preferences?**

      * **JSON Format:** Errors should be returned in a consistent JSON format.

      * **Standard HTTP Status Codes:** Utilize appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `404 Not Found`, `409 Conflict`, `500 Internal Server Error`).

      * **Structured Body:** The JSON error body should include:

          * `code`: A unique, internal error code (e.g., `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`).
          * `message`: A human-readable message explaining the error.
          * `details`: (Optional) An array or object containing specific details, especially for validation errors (e.g., field name, invalid value, specific rule violated).
          * `timestamp`: The time the error occurred (useful for logging and debugging).

      * **Example:**

        ```json
        {
          "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
          "message": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
          "details": [
            {
              "field": "price",
              "value": -10.00,
              "message": "Price must be positive."
            },
            {
              "field": "categoryName",
              "value": "Electronics",
              "message": "Category name 'Electronics' already exists."
            }
          ],
          "timestamp": "2025-07-11T08:13:00Z"
        }
        ```

  * **Logging level requirements? (debug, info, warn, error)**

      * All standard logging levels should be utilized for appropriate message categorization:
          * **ERROR:** For critical issues that prevent functionality (e.g., database connection failures, unhandled exceptions, failed third-party API calls).
          * **WARN:** For potentially problematic situations that don't immediately cause failure but could indicate issues (e.g., deprecated API usage, a process taking longer than expected, a soft-deleted category still having linked products).
          * **INFO:** For general operational messages indicating significant events or progress (e.g., application startup/shutdown, successful API requests, major business logic flows).
          * **DEBUG:** For detailed information useful during development and debugging (e.g., variable values, entry/exit of methods, detailed request/response payloads). This level should typically be disabled or severely restricted in production.

  * **Error tracking/monitoring needs?**

      * Not required for the initial phase.

  * **User-friendly error messages vs technical details?**

      * **User-Friendly Messages for Users:** Error messages returned to the client (especially for UI display) should primarily be user-friendly. They should explain *what* went wrong in plain language and, if possible, *how* the user can fix it (e.g., "The product name is too long," "Category not found"). They should avoid exposing internal system details, stack traces, or database errors.
      * **Technical Details for Logs:** More detailed, technical error information (e.g., stack traces, specific database error codes, request payloads) should be captured in the backend logs (using `ERROR` or `DEBUG` levels). This information is crucial for developers and support teams for debugging and troubleshooting.

### 4\. Technical Architecture Questions

These questions address the underlying technical choices and infrastructure.

#### Technology Stack & Framework

  * **What's your preferred programming language? (Node.js/TypeScript, Python/Django/FastAPI, Java/Spring Boot, Go, etc.)**
      * I prefer Java/Spring Boot.
  * **Do you have any specific framework preferences?**
      * Spring Boot.
  * **Any existing tech stack constraints or company standards?**
      * None specified.

#### Database Design

  * **What's your preferred database? (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)**
      * SQLite.
  * **Do you need ACID compliance for inventory transactions?**
      * Yes.
  * **Expected data volume? (thousands, millions of products/SKUs?)**
      * Thousands of products/SKUs.
  * **Any specific performance requirements for read/write operations?**
      * Standard acceptable performance for 'thousands' of records.

#### API Design & Documentation

  * **REST API format preference? (JSON:API, custom JSON structure)**
      * JSON.
  * **API versioning strategy needed?**
      * Yes.
  * **Documentation tool preference? (OpenAPI/Swagger, Postman, etc.)**
      * OpenAPI/Swagger.
  * **Any specific HTTP status code conventions?**
      * Standard HTTP status codes (2xx for success, 4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors) will be used.

#### Infrastructure & Deployment

  * **Deployment environment? (Docker, cloud services, on-premise)**
      * Not required to specify at this stage.
  * **Need for environment configs? (dev, staging, prod)**
      * Not required to specify at this stage.
  * **Logging and monitoring requirements?**
      * You can use logging frameworks like Slf4j.
  * **Any specific port or configuration preferences?**
      * 8080 is fine.

-----

### 5\. Search & Performance Questions

These questions focus on how users will find products and the expected performance.

#### Search & Filtering

  * **Search complexity needed? (exact match, partial match, fuzzy search)**
      * **Exact Match:** Required for searching by specific IDs (e.g., SKU, Product ID) or exact names where precision is paramount.
      * **Partial Match:** Required for product name search. This allows users to find products even if they only remember part of the name (e.g., searching "iPhone" to find "iPhone 15").
      * **Fuzzy Search:** Not explicitly required, but would enhance user experience for common typos or minor variations in search queries. As a Product Manager, I would consider this a future enhancement rather than a core requirement for the initial build, given the current scope.
  * **Additional filter requirements beyond category? (price range, brand, availability)**
      * Yes, additional filters are needed to enhance product discoverability:
          * **Price Range:** Filter products within a specified minimum and maximum price.
          * **Brand:** Filter products by their brand name.
          * **Availability:** Filter products by their stock status (e.g., "In Stock Only," "Available for Pre-order").
  * **Search performance requirements? (response time expectations)**
      * **Response Time Expectations:** For typical user-facing searches (e.g., listing products with filters and pagination), response times should generally be under 1-2 seconds to provide a good user experience.
      * **Scalability:** The search functionality should be able to handle an increasing number of products and concurrent search queries efficiently, maintaining the specified response times as data volume grows into the "thousands" of products/SKUs.
  * **Search result sorting options needed?**
      * Yes, sorting options will be needed (e.g., by price, name, date added).

#### Pagination & Limits

  * **Default page size preferences?**
      * A common and generally good default page size for listing APIs is 10 or 20 items per page. For this inventory management service, a default of **10 items per page** seems appropriate, given the "thousands" of products/SKUs expected and the need for quick search performance. Users can then override this with the `pageSize` parameter if needed.
  * **Maximum page size limits?**
      * To prevent performance degradation due to excessively large data fetches, a maximum page size should be enforced. A reasonable maximum page size would typically be **50 or 100**. This allows flexibility for users needing more data per request while protecting the system from overwhelming queries.
  * **Total count needed in pagination responses?**
      * Yes, the total count of matching items is needed in pagination responses. This allows the client (e.g., a UI) to:
          * Display the total number of results found.
          * Calculate the total number of pages available.
          * Enable proper pagination controls (e.g., "Page 1 of X").
  * **Any specific pagination format? (offset-based, cursor-based)**
      * For the initial implementation, **offset-based pagination is preferred**.
      * **Rationale:** It is simpler to implement and widely understood. Given the "thousands" of products/SKU's and the current scope, it will adequately meet the needs.
      * **Parameters:** This will typically involve `page` (or `offset`) and `pageSize` (or `limit`) parameters.

-----

### 6\. Testing & Quality Assurance

These cover how the system's reliability and maintainability will be ensured.

#### Testing Strategy

  * **Unit test coverage target? (80%, 90%, 100%?)**
      * Not required to specify a target percentage for the initial phase.
  * **Integration test requirements?**
      * Not required for the initial phase.
  * **Test data setup preferences? (fixtures, factories, seeds)**
      * Not required for the initial phase.
  * **Testing framework preferences?**
      * Standard Java/Spring Boot testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, Mockito) are expected.

#### Code Quality

  * **Code formatting/linting standards?**
      * **Consistent Formatting:** Adhere to a unified code style (e.g., Google Java Format).
      * **Automated Tools:** Utilize **Checkstyle**, **SpotBugs**, and **PMD** integrated via Maven/Gradle plugins and IDEs.
      * **Readability:** Prioritize clear, concise, and well-structured code.
      * **Best Practices:** Follow Spring Boot conventions and Java best practices (e.g., proper annotation use, exception handling, SLF4J logging).
  * **Code review requirements?**
      * Yes, code reviews are required to ensure quality and adherence to standards.
  * **Documentation level needed? (inline comments, API docs, architectural docs)**
      * **API Docs (OpenAPI/Swagger):** **Required.** This will serve as the primary documentation for API consumers, detailing endpoints, request/response formats, and data models.
      * **Inline Comments:** **Required.** Use judiciously for complex logic, non-obvious code, or to explain the "why" behind certain decisions, improving code maintainability.
      * **Architectural Docs (Project-structure.md, README.md):** **Required.**
          * **README.md:** Project overview, setup, and run instructions.
          * **Project-structure.md:** High-level overview of the project's architecture and module organization.
  * **Any specific coding patterns or architectural principles to follow?**
      * Adhere to common Spring Boot architectural patterns (e.g., MVC, layered architecture, dependency injection).

-----

### 7\. Future Considerations

These points address potential growth and future enhancements.

  * **Expected growth trajectory?**
      * **Moderate to High Growth:** Anticipate expansion from thousands to millions of products/SKUs within 1-3 years.
      * **Implications:** Requires scalable design for database, APIs, and robust monitoring.
  * **Future feature considerations? (inventory reservations, multi-location, etc.)**
      * Based on the core inventory management service, future enhancements could include:
          * **Inventory Reservations:** Implement a system to temporarily reserve stock for ongoing orders, preventing overselling before final purchase.
          * **Multi-Location/Warehouse Support:** Extend inventory tracking to manage stock across multiple physical locations or warehouses.
          * **Batch/Lot Tracking:** For products with expiry dates or specific production batches (e.g., food, pharmaceuticals), track inventory by lot number.
          * **Returns Management:** Integrate processes for handling product returns and updating inventory accordingly.
          * **Supplier/Vendor Management:** Link products and SKUs to specific suppliers for easier reordering and procurement.
          * **Demand Forecasting:** Utilize historical sales data to predict future demand and optimize stock levels.
          * **Reporting & Analytics:** Develop advanced reports on inventory turnover, sales performance by product/SKU, and stock valuation.
          * **Integrations:** API integrations with external systems like e-commerce platforms (e.g., Shopify, Magento), shipping carriers, or accounting software.
  * **Integration requirements with other systems?**
      * Not required for the initial phase.
  * **API rate limiting needs?**
      * While not critical for the very first build for admin use, API rate limiting is a **future consideration** for service stability and to prevent abuse.
      * **Rationale:** If APIs become public or are used by many internal systems, rate limiting will be crucial to:
          * **Prevent Abuse/DDoS:** Protect the service from malicious attacks or excessive requests.
          * **Ensure Fair Usage:** Distribute available resources equitably among consumers.
          * **Maintain Stability:** Prevent a single client from overwhelming the service and impacting other users.
      * **Typical Implementation:** This would involve setting limits on the number of requests per time unit (e.g., X requests per minute per IP address or API key) and returning `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status codes when limits are exceeded.

Thank you for the comprehensive answers! As a senior software architect, I have a few additional technical questions to ensure we build a robust, scalable system that aligns with your requirements.

## Additional Technical Architecture Questions

### Database Schema & Performance

**1. Database Relationships & Constraints:**
- For hierarchical categories, what's the maximum nesting depth you anticipate? (affects query performance)
- Should we implement database-level foreign key constraints or handle referential integrity in application layer?
- For soft deletes, do you prefer a `deleted_at` timestamp or `is_deleted` boolean flag?

**2. Indexing Strategy:**
- Which fields will be most frequently searched/filtered? (for optimal index creation)
- Should we implement full-text search indexes for product names/descriptions?
- Any specific database performance benchmarks we should target?

### API Design & Data Models

**3. API Response Structure:**
- For nested categories, should the API return the full hierarchy path or just immediate parent?
- Should product responses include all SKUs by default, or require a separate endpoint call?
- For pagination, do you want cursor-based pagination for better performance with large datasets?

**4. Data Validation & Business Logic:**
- Should SKU codes follow a specific pattern (e.g., PROD001-RED-L) or be completely flexible?
- For price handling, should we store prices in cents/paise to avoid floating-point issues?
- How should we handle concurrent stock updates (optimistic vs pessimistic locking)?

### System Architecture & Scalability

**5. Service Architecture:**
- Should we implement a layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository) or hexagonal architecture?
- Do you want separate services for each entity or a single monolithic service?
- Should we implement caching (Redis/in-memory) for frequently accessed data?

**6. Transaction Management:**
- For operations affecting multiple entities (e.g., creating product with SKUs), should we use database transactions?
- How should we handle partial failures in batch operations?

### Error Handling & Monitoring

**7. Logging & Observability:**
- Should we implement structured logging (JSON format) for better log analysis?
- Do you want request/response logging for audit purposes?
- Should we implement health check endpoints for monitoring?

**8. Validation Strategy:**
- Should validation be handled at DTO level, service level, or both?
- For hierarchical categories, how should we validate circular references?

Now, let me create the Business PRD document based on your requirements:
